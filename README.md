## About Me

Hi there, I am 0x5BFA.
I code every day for the fun of building something that excites me and I am proficient in C and C# and have developed a lot of software as you can see below.

Currently, I'm the owner and a maintainer of [FluentHub](https://github.com/0x5bfa/FluentHub) and a developer team member of [Files](https://github.com/files-community/files).

In the future, I would like to become well versed in various fields, including the web and low-layer fields, and develop with wonderful people at a tech giant.
