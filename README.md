## Hi there 👋

I work on what I think I have to do every day to achieve my biggest goal in my life.
<br/>
Right now, working on my second biggest goal irl, which must be done before that.

- 🏫 Not yet in university
- 💬 Speak Japanese and English *a bit*
- 📝 C & C#
- 👨‍💻 Win32 API (filesystem and console) & WinUI
- 🔭 Working on [Files app](https://files.community)
- 🌱 Learning Windows low-level Win32 APIs for file system and shell
- 👯 Want to learn kernel debugging and UEFI development
